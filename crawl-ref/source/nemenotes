A vanilla gift is 4-13 cards, exactly like an old deck, with the same
gifting timeout

Vanilla has destruction having maximum size 26, others 13.

"Compared to the effects in summoning and escape, destruction effects
tend to be a single turn conjuration (Storm and top tier Pain need
adjustment here) which makes them comparatively weaker"

Archetype decks:
Battle
Destruction
Dungeons (removed 0.15)
Emergency
Enchantments (removed 0.15, near-empty, never existed as item)
Oddities (never dropped, many weird effects, any draw had a 1% chance
          to be an Oddity).
Punishment
Summoning
Transport
Wonders

Removed cards where removal makes sense:
out Shaft (similar to Exile but doesn't work on bottom of branch, removed
       later in vanilla)
out Bones (replaced with The Rangers on the basis that skeleton summoning
       is not a new trick)
out Bargain (discount on shop prices for a duration, effectively some gold
         that's hard to use.)
out Map (did magic mapping, merged into dowsing)
out Sage (diverts incoming XP towards a skill, meaningless today)

Removed cards that seem fine:
in  Alchemist (exchanged some gold for HP and sometimes MP)
in  Banshee (Drain and Cause Fear on all monsters in view)
out Curse (curses items, intentionally bad)
out Feast (maximum nutrition)
out Focus (remove point from worst stat and add to best)
in  Fortitude (damage shaving and strength)
in  Hammer (cast a single target Earth attack spell)
out Helix (shuffles your mutations, probably helpfully at high power)
in  Potion (grants various beneficial potion effects)
in  Repulsiveness (summons ugly things)
in  Shadow (grants invisibility and bonus stealth)
out Placid Magic (drains MP, saps magic, an intentionally bad card)
in  Solitude (casts Dispersal, blinking nearby monsters away)
in  Warpwright (places a teleport trap near the player)
out Shuffle (shuffles your stats - Changes/Oddities only, rare)
in  Portal was Warp (blink, with control at high power)

Removed cards that want work:
#Blade (grants cleaving, which is a bit sad if you're using an axe;
##       used to temporarily apply a brand or animate the weapon, so if
#        restored wants improvement)
#Helm (granted Phase Shift or Stoneskin, two themselves removed
#      defensive buffs, removed 0.18)
# seems fine as is
out Herd (summoned Lair monsters, removed 0.16... find out why)
 replaced with Elements fair enough
#Mercenary (grants a durable summoned ally who can level up - but the
#           list of allies needs a look)
# won't return, treads on Hep's toes
out Metamorphosis (assorted Transmutations forms, nearly always bad if you
               don't use Unarmed Combat - move to
	       Wonders/Changes/Oddities not the combat decks)
in Venom (casts a poison spell which probably doesn't do much and gives
       you rPois-)
   now doesn't if Nemelexie
out Xom (makes Xom act - fine in Oddities but a bit weird in Punishment
     given Xom's actions rarely _do_ much...)
# Battlelust (grants might, slaying, or "building rage" - what's that?)
# made you go berserk at high power, otherwise might/agil which
# you get from other cards
#Experience (grants XP up to a whole level at high power, too good?)
# won't return
Flight (can grant Hippo Form (which made sense when player hippos
        could cling), Bat Form; or Flight and Swiftness and maybe
	place a shaft; and maybe make you invisible for a little)
Genie (gives acquirement or degeneration or rotting)	
Minefield (places traps in a radius around the player, probably good
           given you know it's happened... but is it then Punishment?)
Portal (teleports you - at high power, with control, granting teleport
        control for six turns)
Frost (replaced with Hammer for interface reasons, could be salvaged?)
Flame (ditto)
Spark (ditto)
Summoning (summoned a demon, terrible name, removed long ago, do other
           cards summon demons?)

The deck of dungeons, which has interesting cards but it's hard to
know _when_ you'd use them, and some want thought:
Dowsing (can give magic mapping, detect items/traps, and temporary
         antenna-like telepathy...)
Spade (one-shot wand of digging)
Trowel (can create decorations, an altar, a friendly golem and a
hostile statue, or once per game a portal to a portal branch)
Vitrification (Xom-style but at high level it can do the _whole
               level_)
Water (turns squares into deep and shallow water, was in the deck of
       Summoning, why?)

Removed cards that specifically want thought for a Nemelex worshipper
in good standing:
Crusade (casts Aura of Abjuration, at higher power may charm monsters,
         is getting only abjuration too harsh for worshippers, but
	 that only happens at power 0 and can a Nemelexie with decent
	 piety/invo even get that?)
Swap (transposes the player with a nearby adjacent monster,
      maybe make it drain stuff around the destination a la
      Transference?)
	 
What I'm thinking of for Nemelex worshippers is that they should
never get a bad result from a card Nemelex can grant or one that's
mostly good. Probably also they should not be able to get Oddities
from combat-oriented decks.

Notes to self:

Damnation card wasn't removed, it was renamed.

If I don't say when something was removed, it was probably removed in
the big 0.19 shakeup when decks became Nemelex alone.

The deck of Wonders had rather shrunk when removed, and overlapped
badly with Changes. Also, arguably Hypothetically Optimal Man should
max Evocations, find a safeish place, and just run through a deck of
Wonders. Think about how often they drop and how many cards they
have. Most of the arguably-problematic effects there like Genie and
Experience would be fine if they just came from Oddities and/or
Wonders was very rare.

There have been decks of escape and emergency and Nemelex has granted
one or the other at different times. Probably one should be granted
and the other have more oddball maybe-useful effects like Swap in?

describe-god penance descriptions moved

Even older wonder cards:

butterfly (creates butterflies)
wraith    (lose level, drain XP)
wealth    (gives gold)
int/str/quicksilver/stupid/weak/sloth
          (better than they look - could easily increase max but less
	  likely to decrease it - but could stat zero you quite easily)
freak     (mutate)
death     (reapers)
normality (unmutate)
statue    (friendly crystal golem)
acquisition (acquirement)
hasten    (haste self)
lich      (hostile lich)
decay     (rot)
altar     (create altar)
fountain  (ditto fountain)
maze      (cast into labyrinth)
pandemonium (ditto)

tricks:
teleport     (with control?)
teleport now (with control?)
rage         (berserk)
levity       (flight)
healing      (curing?)

power:
heal wounds  (as potion)
violence     (acq weapon)
protection   (acq armour)
knowledge    (acq book)
torment
slow         (slows you, bad)
