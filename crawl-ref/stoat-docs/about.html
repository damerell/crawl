    <h1>You want to talk about Stoat Soup</h1>
    <p>There is a #dcss-variants channel in the <a
  href="https://discord.gg/RtE2FxHmZ8">Roguelikes Discord</a>; I read
  basically all traffic there. <a
  href="https://github.com/damerell/crawl/issues">Github issues</a>
  can be used for bug reports or suggestions. I am "stoatsoup" on
  reddit and <a href="https://tavern.dcss.io/">Crawl's "Tavern"
  forum</a>.</p> 
    <h1>Things about playing Stoat Soup</h1>
    <h2>If you already play Crawl online</h2>
    <p>Stoat Soup webtiles is available
      on <a href="https://crawl.project357.org/">CPO</a>, which is
      in Australia,
      <a href="https://crawl.nemelex.cards">CNC</a> in Korea,
      and <a href="https://crawl.yiuf.org">CYO</a> in North America. 
      The development
      version is available for console play only by ssh-ing to
      "crawl.montres.org.uk" (which is in the UK) using username
      "fortunato" and
      the <a href="https://crawl.develz.org/wordpress/howto">usual ssh
      key</a> used for online play (or use <a href="poe.key">this
      key</a> if you need a newer one - <a href="poe.ppk">PuTTY
	key</a> here). CNC also provides console play on port 1326 with username "nemelex" and the usual key.</p>
    <h3>Changes in Stoat Soup</h3>
    <p>Maybe you've been playing Crawl for years and
    want <a href="about-old.html">a complete account</a> of the
      changes.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, you just want <a href="about-new.html">Stoat
Soup for 0.30 players</a>, to know what might trip you up if you're
used to modern vanilla DCSS.</p>
    <h2>You want to play locally, not online</h2>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/damerell/crawl/releases">Windows tiles builds</a> are periodically made available for local play.</p>
    <p>If you want to compile it yourself (the easiest way for local
    play on Linux), the source is
    available <a href="http://github.com/damerell/crawl">on github</a>
    and the process is the same as vanilla DCSS.</p>
    <h2>You don't already play Crawl</h2>
    <p>Many people play Crawl online. Vanilla Crawl publishes
    a <a href="https://crawl.develz.org/wordpress/howto">guide to
    playing online</a> and those instructions will let you use the
    online servers listed above. If you want to play offline, it's
    easy to download the Windows build above, and it's also easy to
    build it yourself on Linux.</p>
    <h3>You want a tutorial</h3>
    <p>You can get a tutorial in local play, or online on
      crawl.montres.org.uk.</p>
    <h3>You have played NetHack</h3>
    <p>Good choice! Crawl is a very distant descendant of
    NetHack. There's a <a href="for-nethack.txt">guide to Stoat Soup
	for NetHack players</a>.</p>
    <h2>You want to run a server</h2>
    <p>A
      <a href="https://github.com/refracta/dcss-server">containerised
	server</a> is available to run a wide variety of Crawl
      variants (including Stoat Soup).</p>
    <h2>bold_brightens_foreground</h2>
    <p>If you don't play console ("ASCII") this bit doesn't matter.</p>
    <p>There is a convention for terminal clients that bold black text
    is drawn in a dark grey. Unfortunately, this convention isn't
    universally respected, and if you have a terminal client that gets
    it wrong, you won't be able to see the things Crawl draws in dark
    grey, including important things like walls out of your field of
      view.</p>
    <p>Crawl has an option, "bold_brightens_foreground", which if it
    is turned off instead draws these things in blue. This looks
    horrible but at least you can see what you're doing. In vanilla
    Crawl it defaults to being turned off. In Stoat Soup, it defaults
    to being turned on, because watching ttyrecs with the walls dark
      blue gives me a headache.</p>
    <p>So, if you have this problem where you can't see walls out of
    your field of view, you'll need to edit your options to set
    "bold_brightens_foreground = false", or fix your terminal
      client.</p>
